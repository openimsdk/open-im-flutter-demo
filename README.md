OpenIM provides an open-source Instant Messaging (IM) SDK for developers, serving as an alternative solution to cloud services like Twilio and Sendbird. With OpenIM, developers can build secure and reliable IM applications similar to WeChat, Zoom, and Slack.

This repository is based on the open-source version of the OpenIM SDK, offering an Flutter IM application. You can use this application as a reference implementation of the OpenIM SDK.

   ```

3. Modify the configuration

     > If you have not changed the default server ports, update only the [_host](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-flutter-demo/blob/a309f25fdbc143e49d5ca852171ce57970871c85/openim_common/lib/src/config.dart#L59) to your server IP.

   ```

4. Run the application using `flutter run` from the terminal or through your IDE.

5. Start developing and testing! 🎉

## Audio/Video Calls

## FAQ

##### 1. Does it support multiple languages?

A: Support, follow the system language by default

##### 2. Which platforms are supported?

A: The demo currently supports android and ios.

##### 3. The debug of the android installation package can run, but the release starts with a white screen?

A: The release package of flutter is obfuscated by default. You can use the command: flutter build release --no -shrink. If this command is invalid, you can do the following

Add the following configuration to the release configuration configured in android/app/build.gradle

```
release {
    minifyEnabled false
    useProguard false
    shrinkResources false
}
```

##### 4. What should I do if the code must be confused?

A: Add the following rules to the obfuscation rules

```
-keep class io.openim.**{*;}
-keep class open_im_sdk.**{*;}
-keep class open_im_sdk_callback.**{*;}
```

##### 5. The android installation package cannot be installed on the emulator?

A: Because the Demo has removed some cpu architectures, if you want to run it on the emulator, please do the following:

Add in android/build.gradle configuration

```
ndk {
    abiFilters "armeabi-v7a",  "x86"
}
```
